Installing on Windows 

1.Node.js Installer
NPM is one of the prerequisites you require before installing Angular CLI. Angular will need to have Node.js in your system for it to run (the 8.x or the 10.x version). Node.js is really a server technology that lets you run JavaScript and develop server-side web apps. You can skip this step if you already have it installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Move through the pages. Click on Finish to have it installed in your computer.



2.Test Installation of Node.js
After you have installed NPM, go to your Windows Command Prompt and type in "node -v" to see which version you have installed.


3.Install Angular CLI
The next step is to install Angular CLI. Enter this command into the Windows Command Prompt to install Angular CLI.

### npm install –g @angular/cli

Verify the configured version after you've added all of the packages using 
### ng –version

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
